# DMRC
Web Scrapping program written in python.

This program takes the real time data from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) website, i.e., the fares, the list of stations. It creates a CSV file which includes FromStation code, ToStation code, Normal Fare, Concessional Fare, Travelling Time, Number of Stations, and stations to be Interchanged. A seperate text file is also created which consists of the stations with their respective codes for reference.
